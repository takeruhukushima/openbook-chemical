<p>This textbook has provided a comprehensive journey through the
essential concepts of relativistic chemistry and thermodynamics, with a
focus on their applications in modern chemical science. We began by
establishing the foundations of special relativity and quantum
mechanics, then explored how these principles merge to form relativistic
quantum chemistry. We investigated the profound impact of relativistic
effects on atomic and molecular properties, chemical bonding, and
various chemical phenomena. Finally, we delved into advanced
thermodynamics, extending classical concepts to statistical and
non-equilibrium systems.</p>

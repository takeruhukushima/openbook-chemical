Atomic Structure</h1>
<p>This chapter transitions from the fundamentals of quantum mechanics
to the realm of particle physics and atomic structure. We will explore
the elementary particles that constitute matter and the forces that
govern their interactions. Understanding these concepts is crucial for
delving into relativistic quantum chemistry, as relativistic effects
become significant in heavier atoms and molecules due to the involvement
of core electrons and their interactions with the nucleus.</p>
<h2 id="elementary-particles">3.1 Elementary Particles</h2>
<p>The Standard Model of particle physics describes the known elementary
particles and their interactions. These particles are classified into
fermions (matter particles) and bosons (force carriers).</p>
<h3 id="fermions-matter-particles">3.1.1 Fermions: Matter Particles</h3>
<p>Fermions are particles that obey Fermi-Dirac statistics and have
half-integer spins. They are the building blocks of matter and are
divided into quarks and leptons.</p>
<h4 id="quarks">Quarks</h4>
<p>Quarks are fundamental constituents of protons and neutrons, and are
confined within hadrons due to the strong force. There are six flavors
of quarks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Up (u)</li>
<li>Down (d)</li>
<li>Charm (c)</li>
<li>Strange (s)</li>
<li>Top (t)</li>
<li>Bottom (b)</li>
</ul>
<p>Each quark also has an antiquark counterpart.</p>
<h4 id="leptons">Leptons</h4>
<p>Leptons are elementary particles that do not experience the strong
force. There are six leptons, also grouped into three generations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Electron (e)</li>
<li>Electron neutrino (<span
class="math inline"><em>ν</em><sub><em>e</em></sub></span>)</li>
<li>Muon (<span class="math inline"><em>μ</em></span>)</li>
<li>Muon neutrino (<span
class="math inline"><em>ν</em><sub><em>μ</em></sub></span>)</li>
<li>Tau (<span class="math inline"><em>τ</em></span>)</li>
<li>Tau neutrino (<span
class="math inline"><em>ν</em><sub><em>τ</em></sub></span>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Each lepton also has an antilepton counterpart.</p>
<h3 id="bosons-force-carriers">3.1.2 Bosons: Force Carriers</h3>
<p>Bosons are particles that obey Bose-Einstein statistics and have
integer spins. They mediate the fundamental forces of nature.</p>
<h4 id="gauge-bosons">Gauge Bosons</h4>
<p>Gauge bosons mediate the fundamental forces:</p>
<ul>
<li>Photon (<span class="math inline"><em>γ</em></span>): mediates the
electromagnetic force.</li>
<li>Gluon (g): mediates the strong force.</li>
<li>Weak bosons (<span
class="math inline"><em>W</em><sup>+</sup>, <em>W</em><sup>−</sup>, <em>Z</em><sup>0</sup></span>):
mediate the weak force.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="higgs-boson">Higgs Boson</h4>
<p>The Higgs boson is responsible for the Higgs field, which gives mass
to elementary particles through the Higgs mechanism.</p>
<h2 id="atomic-structure">3.2 Atomic Structure</h2>
<p>Atomic structure is determined by the electromagnetic interaction
between the nucleus and electrons, governed by quantum mechanics.</p>
<h3 id="nucleus">3.2.1 Nucleus</h3>
<p>The nucleus of an atom consists of protons and neutrons (except for
hydrogen-1, which has only a proton). Protons are positively charged,
and neutrons are neutral. The number of protons determines the atomic
number and the element’s identity.</p>
<h3 id="electrons-and-orbitals">3.2.2 Electrons and Orbitals</h3>
<p>Electrons are negatively charged fermions that occupy atomic orbitals
around the nucleus. These orbitals are described by quantum numbers
(principal, azimuthal, magnetic, and spin) and determine the electronic
configuration of an atom.</p>
<h3 id="electronic-configuration">3.2.3 Electronic Configuration</h3>
<p>The electronic configuration describes the arrangement of electrons
in atomic orbitals. It follows rules such as the Aufbau principle,
Hund’s rule, and the Pauli exclusion principle. The electronic
configuration is crucial for understanding the chemical properties of
elements.</p>
<h2 id="forces-in-atoms">3.3 Forces in Atoms</h2>
<p>Atoms are held together by fundamental forces, primarily the
electromagnetic force and the strong force (within the nucleus).</p>
<h3 id="electromagnetic-force">3.3.1 Electromagnetic Force</h3>
<p>The electromagnetic force is responsible for the attraction between
the positively charged nucleus and the negatively charged electrons. It
governs chemical bonding and interactions between atoms and
molecules.</p>
<h3 id="strong-force">3.3.2 Strong Force</h3>
<p>The strong force is responsible for binding protons and neutrons
together in the nucleus, overcoming the electrostatic repulsion between
protons.</p>
<h3 id="weak-force-and-gravity">3.3.3 Weak Force and Gravity</h3>
<p>The weak force is responsible for radioactive decay and plays a role
in nuclear processes. Gravity is negligible at the atomic level compared
to electromagnetic and strong forces.</p>
<h2 id="quantum-numbers-and-atomic-orbitals">3.4 Quantum Numbers and
Atomic Orbitals</h2>
<p>Quantum numbers are essential for describing the state of electrons
in atoms and the properties of atomic orbitals.</p>
<h3 id="principal-quantum-number-n">3.4.1 Principal Quantum Number
(n)</h3>
<p>The principal quantum number <span
class="math inline"><em>n</em></span> is a positive integer (<span
class="math inline"><em>n</em> = 1, 2, 3, …</span>) that determines the
energy level of an electron and the size of the orbital. Higher <span
class="math inline"><em>n</em></span> values correspond to higher energy
levels and larger orbitals.</p>
<h3 id="azimuthal-quantum-number-l">3.4.2 Azimuthal Quantum Number
(l)</h3>
<p>The azimuthal quantum number <span
class="math inline"><em>l</em></span> (or angular momentum quantum
number) is an integer that ranges from <span
class="math inline">0</span> to <span
class="math inline"><em>n</em> − 1</span> (<span
class="math inline"><em>l</em> = 0, 1, 2, …, <em>n</em> − 1</span>). It
determines the shape of the atomic orbital and has subshell
designations:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline"><em>l</em> = 0</span>: s orbitals
(spherical)</li>
<li><span class="math inline"><em>l</em> = 1</span>: p orbitals
(dumbbell-shaped)</li>
<li><span class="math inline"><em>l</em> = 2</span>: d orbitals (more
complex shapes)</li>
<li><span class="math inline"><em>l</em> = 3</span>: f orbitals (even
more complex shapes)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="magnetic-quantum-number-m_l">3.4.3 Magnetic Quantum Number
(<span class="math inline"><em>m</em><sub><em>l</em></sub></span>)</h3>
<p>The magnetic quantum number <span
class="math inline"><em>m</em><sub><em>l</em></sub></span> is an integer
that ranges from <span class="math inline">−<em>l</em></span> to <span
class="math inline">+<em>l</em></span> (including 0). It determines the
orientation of the atomic orbital in space. For a given <span
class="math inline"><em>l</em></span>, there are <span
class="math inline">2<em>l</em> + 1</span> possible <span
class="math inline"><em>m</em><sub><em>l</em></sub></span> values
(orbitals).</p>
<h3 id="spin-quantum-number-m_s">3.4.4 Spin Quantum Number (<span
class="math inline"><em>m</em><sub><em>s</em></sub></span>)</h3>
<p>The spin quantum number <span
class="math inline"><em>m</em><sub><em>s</em></sub></span> describes the
intrinsic angular momentum of an electron, which is also quantized and
called spin angular momentum. For electrons, there are two possible spin
states:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">$m_s = +\frac{1}{2}$</span> (spin up,
<span class="math inline">↑</span>)</li>
<li><span class="math inline">$m_s = -\frac{1}{2}$</span> (spin down,
<span class="math inline">↓</span>)</li>
</ul>
<p>These quantum numbers provide a complete description of an electron
in an atom and are fundamental to understanding atomic structure and
chemical bonding.</p>
<h2 id="periodic-table-and-atomic-properties">3.5 Periodic Table and
Atomic Properties</h2>
<p>The periodic table organizes elements based on their atomic number
and recurring chemical properties, which are directly related to their
electronic configurations.</p>
<h3 id="organization-of-the-periodic-table">3.5.1 Organization of the
Periodic Table</h3>
<p>The periodic table is arranged in rows (periods) and columns
(groups). Elements in the same group have similar valence electronic
configurations and thus similar chemical properties. Periods correspond
to the principal quantum number <span
class="math inline"><em>n</em></span>, and groups are related to the
number of valence electrons.</p>
<h3 id="trends-in-atomic-properties">3.5.2 Trends in Atomic
Properties</h3>
<p>Several atomic properties show periodic trends across the periodic
table:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Atomic Radius</strong>: Generally decreases across a period
(from left to right) and increases down a group.</li>
<li><strong>Ionization Energy</strong>: Generally increases across a
period and decreases down a group.</li>
<li><strong>Electron Affinity</strong>: Shows complex trends but
generally becomes more negative across a period and less negative down a
group.</li>
<li><strong>Electronegativity</strong>: Generally increases across a
period and decreases down a group.</li>
</ul>
<p>These periodic trends are essential for predicting and understanding
the chemical behavior of elements and their compounds.</p>
<h2 id="relativistic-effects-in-atomic-structure">3.6 Relativistic
Effects in Atomic Structure</h2>
<p>For heavier elements, especially those in the lower periods of the
periodic table, relativistic effects become significant. These effects
arise from the high speeds of core electrons, which are closer to the
nucleus and experience a stronger electromagnetic force.</p>
<h3 id="origin-of-relativistic-effects">3.6.1 Origin of Relativistic
Effects</h3>
<p>Relativistic effects originate from Einstein’s theory of special
relativity, which modifies the equations of motion for particles moving
at speeds approaching the speed of light. For core electrons in heavy
atoms, their speeds can be a significant fraction of the speed of light,
making relativistic corrections necessary.</p>
<h3 id="consequences-of-relativistic-effects">3.6.2 Consequences of
Relativistic Effects</h3>
<p>Relativistic effects have several important consequences for atomic
structure and chemical properties:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Contraction of s Orbitals</strong>: Relativistic effects
cause the s orbitals to contract and become more tightly bound to the
nucleus. This is because relativistic mass increase leads to increased
effective nuclear charge experienced by s electrons, which have a higher
probability density near the nucleus.</li>
<li><strong>Expansion of p, d, and f Orbitals</strong>: While s orbitals
contract, p, d, and f orbitals tend to expand and become less tightly
bound. This is due to increased shielding from the contracted s orbitals
and other indirect relativistic effects.</li>
<li><strong>Spin-Orbit Splitting</strong>: Relativistic effects lead to
spin-orbit coupling, which splits energy levels based on the interaction
between the electron’s spin and orbital angular momentum. This splitting
is particularly significant for heavier elements and affects their
spectroscopic and magnetic properties.</li>
<li><strong>Inert Pair Effect</strong>: Relativistic contraction of s
orbitals can make the s electrons less available for bonding in heavier
p-block elements, leading to the inert pair effect, where the heavier
elements in groups 13-16 exhibit lower oxidation states than lighter
congeners.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="importance-in-heavy-elements">3.6.3 Importance in Heavy
Elements</h3>
<p>Relativistic effects are crucial for accurately describing the
electronic structure and properties of heavy elements. They explain many
anomalous properties observed in heavy element chemistry, such as the
color of gold, the liquidity of mercury at room temperature, and the
chemical behavior of lead and other heavy metals.</p>
<p>In summary, understanding particle physics and atomic structure,
including relativistic effects, is essential for a comprehensive grasp
of chemistry, especially when dealing with heavier elements and
relativistic quantum chemistry. This chapter provides the necessary
foundation for exploring these advanced topics in subsequent
chapters.</p>

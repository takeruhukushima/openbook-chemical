<h1 id="relativistic-effects-in-heavy-elements">Relativistic Effects in
Heavy Elements</h1>
<p>This chapter focuses specifically on the profound impact of
relativistic effects on the properties of heavy elements. As we move
down the periodic table, the inner core electrons in atoms of heavy
elements approach speeds comparable to the speed of light. This
necessitates the use of relativistic quantum mechanics to accurately
describe their electronic structure and properties. We will explore how
relativistic effects manifest in heavy elements, influencing their
chemical behavior, physical properties, and spectroscopic
characteristics.</p>
<h2 id="introduction-to-heavy-elements">8.1 Introduction to Heavy
Elements</h2>
<p>Heavy elements are generally considered to be those in the later
periods and groups of the periodic table, typically starting from the
6th period (elements with atomic number Z &gt; 54, Xenon). These
elements are characterized by:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>High Nuclear Charge</strong>: Leading to strong
electrostatic attraction between the nucleus and electrons.</li>
<li><strong>Large Number of Electrons</strong>: Resulting in complex
electronic configurations and significant electron-electron
interactions.</li>
<li><strong>Inner Core Electrons at Relativistic Speeds</strong>: Core
electrons, especially s electrons, experience strong nuclear attraction
and move at relativistic speeds.</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples of heavy elements include gold (Au), mercury (Hg), lead
(Pb), platinum (Pt), uranium (U), and transuranic elements.</p>
<h2 id="manifestations-of-relativistic-effects-in-heavy-elements">8.2
Manifestations of Relativistic Effects in Heavy Elements</h2>
<p>Relativistic effects in heavy elements lead to several significant
consequences that deviate from non-relativistic predictions.</p>
<h3 id="relativistic-contraction-and-stabilization-of-s-orbitals">8.2.1
Relativistic Contraction and Stabilization of s Orbitals</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Direct Relativistic Effect</strong>: The most prominent
relativistic effect is the contraction and stabilization of s orbitals.
As discussed in earlier chapters, this is due to the increased velocity
of s electrons near the nucleus, leading to relativistic mass increase
and stronger binding.</li>
<li><strong>Impact on Valence s Orbitals</strong>: The contraction of
core s orbitals propagates to valence s orbitals, making them more
compact, lower in energy, and less available for bonding in some cases
(inert pair effect).</li>
</ul>
<h3
id="relativistic-expansion-and-destabilization-of-p-and-d-orbitals">8.2.2
Relativistic Expansion and Destabilization of p and d Orbitals</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Indirect Relativistic Effect</strong>: Due to the
contraction of s orbitals, the shielding of the nuclear charge
experienced by p, d, and f orbitals is enhanced. This leads to the
expansion and destabilization of these orbitals.</li>
<li><strong>Energy Level Splitting</strong>: Relativistic effects,
particularly spin-orbit coupling, cause splitting of p, d, and f
orbitals into subshells with different energies.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="spin-orbit-coupling-in-heavy-elements">8.2.3 Spin-Orbit Coupling
in Heavy Elements</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Significant Effect</strong>: Spin-orbit coupling, the
interaction between an electron’s spin and its orbital angular momentum,
becomes very strong in heavy elements due to the high nuclear charge and
electron velocities.</li>
<li><strong>j-j Coupling Scheme</strong>: In heavy elements, the j-j
coupling scheme, where individual electron spin and orbital angular
momenta are coupled first (<span
class="math inline"><em>j</em> = <em>l</em> + <em>s</em></span>),
becomes more appropriate than the Russell-Saunders (L-S) coupling
scheme, which is valid for lighter elements.</li>
<li><strong>Splitting of Energy Levels</strong>: Spin-orbit coupling
splits atomic energy levels, leading to distinct spectroscopic and
magnetic properties. For example, p orbitals split into <span
class="math inline"><em>p</em><sub>1/2</sub></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>p</em><sub>3/2</sub></span> subshells, d
orbitals into <span class="math inline"><em>d</em><sub>3/2</sub></span>
and <span class="math inline"><em>d</em><sub>5/2</sub></span>, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="relativistic-effects-on-chemical-properties">8.3 Relativistic
Effects on Chemical Properties</h2>
<p>Relativistic effects dramatically alter the chemical properties of
heavy elements, leading to unique behaviors that are not observed in
lighter congeners.</p>
<h3 id="inert-pair-effect">8.3.1 Inert Pair Effect</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition</strong>: The inert pair effect is the tendency
of heavier p-block elements (e.g., Tl, Pb, Bi) to be more stable in
lower oxidation states than predicted by non-relativistic trends. For
example, <span
class="math inline"><em>P</em><em>b</em><sup>2+</sup></span> is more
stable than <span
class="math inline"><em>P</em><em>b</em><sup>4+</sup></span>.</li>
<li><strong>Relativistic Origin</strong>: Relativistic contraction and
stabilization of valence s orbitals (<span
class="math inline"><em>n</em><em>s</em></span>) make these orbitals
less available for bonding, thus favoring lower oxidation states where
the <span class="math inline"><em>n</em><em>s</em><sup>2</sup></span>
electrons remain as a “lone pair.”</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="unique-properties-of-gold">8.3.2 Unique Properties of Gold</h3>
<p>Gold (Au) exhibits several unusual properties due to relativistic
effects:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow Color</strong>: The characteristic yellow color of
gold is a relativistic effect. Relativistic calculations show that the
<span class="math inline">6<em>s</em> → 5<em>d</em></span> electronic
transition energy in gold is increased into the blue light region,
causing absorption of blue light and reflection of yellow light.
Non-relativistically, gold would be silvery.</li>
<li><strong>Aurophilic Interactions</strong>: Weak attractive
interactions between closed-shell <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em><em>u</em>(<em>I</em>)</span> ions (<span
class="math inline"><em>d</em><sup>10</sup> − <em>d</em><sup>10</sup></span>
interactions) are enhanced by relativistic effects, leading to unique
supramolecular structures and materials.</li>
<li><strong>High Electronegativity and Reactivity</strong>: Relativistic
effects increase the electronegativity of gold, making it more reactive
than expected and enabling it to form compounds with higher oxidation
states (e.g., <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em><em>u</em><em>F</em><sub>5</sub></span>).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="liquidity-of-mercury">8.3.3 Liquidity of Mercury</h3>
<p>Mercury (Hg) is liquid at room temperature, unlike other metals, due
to relativistic effects:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Weak Hg-Hg Bonds</strong>: Relativistic effects weaken the
metallic bonding in mercury. The <span
class="math inline">6<em>s</em></span> orbital contraction reduces the
overlap and interaction of valence electrons, lowering the cohesive
energy and melting point of mercury.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="relativistic-effects-in-superheavy-elements">8.3.4 Relativistic
Effects in Superheavy Elements</h3>
<p>Superheavy elements (SHEs, Z &gt; 103) are predicted to have even
more pronounced relativistic effects:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Orbital Energies and Ordering</strong>: Relativistic effects
can alter the ordering of electronic orbitals in SHEs, potentially
leading to different valence electron configurations than predicted
non-relativistically.</li>
<li><strong>Stability of High Oxidation States</strong>: Relativistic
effects might stabilize unusually high oxidation states in some
SHEs.</li>
<li><strong>Chemical Properties</strong>: Predictions of chemical
properties of SHEs rely heavily on relativistic calculations, as
experimental studies are extremely challenging due to their short
half-lives and production difficulties.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="relativistic-effects-on-physical-properties">8.4 Relativistic
Effects on Physical Properties</h2>
<p>Relativistic effects also influence the physical properties of heavy
elements.</p>
<h3 id="melting-and-boiling-points">8.4.1 Melting and Boiling
Points</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lower Melting Points</strong>: For some heavy metals like
mercury, relativistic effects lead to weaker metallic bonding and lower
melting points.</li>
<li><strong>Higher Boiling Points</strong>: In some cases, relativistic
effects can enhance interatomic interactions, potentially increasing
boiling points, although this effect is less pronounced for melting
points.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="density-and-atomic-radii">8.4.2 Density and Atomic Radii</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Increased Density</strong>: Relativistic contraction of
orbitals leads to more compact atoms and increased density in heavy
elements.</li>
<li><strong>Reduced Atomic Radii</strong>: Relativistic effects
generally cause a decrease in atomic and ionic radii compared to
non-relativistic predictions.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ionization-potentials-and-electron-affinities">8.4.3 Ionization
Potentials and Electron Affinities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Increased Ionization Potentials</strong>: Relativistic
stabilization of s orbitals increases the ionization potentials of heavy
elements, making it more difficult to remove electrons.</li>
<li><strong>Increased Electron Affinities</strong>: Relativistic effects
can also increase electron affinities in some heavy elements.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="spectroscopic-properties">8.4.4 Spectroscopic Properties</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shifted Electronic Transitions</strong>: Relativistic
effects shift electronic transition energies, affecting UV-Vis spectra
and colors of heavy element compounds (e.g., color of gold).</li>
<li><strong>Spin-Orbit Splitting in Spectra</strong>: Spin-orbit
coupling leads to fine structure in atomic and molecular spectra of
heavy elements.</li>
<li><strong>Magnetic Properties</strong>: Relativistic effects influence
magnetic properties, such as magnetic susceptibility and NMR parameters,
especially for paramagnetic heavy element compounds.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="computational-relativistic-chemistry">8.5 Computational
Relativistic Chemistry</h2>
<p>Accurate theoretical studies of heavy elements and their compounds
require relativistic quantum chemical methods.</p>
<h3 id="relativistic-hamiltonians">8.5.1 Relativistic Hamiltonians</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dirac Hamiltonian</strong>: The Dirac Hamiltonian is the
fully relativistic Hamiltonian for a single electron, incorporating
special relativity.</li>
<li><strong>Dirac-Coulomb Hamiltonian</strong>: For many-electron
systems, the Dirac-Coulomb Hamiltonian is often used, which includes the
Dirac Hamiltonian for each electron and the Coulomb interaction between
electrons.</li>
<li><strong>Breit Interaction</strong>: For higher accuracy, the Breit
interaction can be added to account for relativistic corrections to
electron-electron interactions.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="relativistic-quantum-chemical-methods">8.5.2 Relativistic
Quantum Chemical Methods</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dirac-Hartree-Fock (DHF)</strong>: Relativistic extension of
Hartree-Fock theory using the Dirac Hamiltonian.</li>
<li><strong>Relativistic Density Functional Theory (RDFT)</strong>:
Relativistic versions of DFT, incorporating relativistic kinematics and
spin-orbit coupling.</li>
<li><strong>Relativistic Post-HF Methods</strong>: Relativistic versions
of post-Hartree-Fock methods like MPn, CI, and CC, such as relativistic
coupled cluster (RCC) theory.</li>
<li><strong>Douglas-Kroll-Hess (DKH) and Zeroth-Order Regular
Approximation (ZORA)</strong>: Approximations to the Dirac equation that
simplify relativistic calculations while retaining most relativistic
effects, often used in practical calculations.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="basis-sets-for-relativistic-calculations">8.5.3 Basis Sets for
Relativistic Calculations</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Relativistic Basis Sets</strong>: Basis sets designed for
relativistic calculations, often using contracted Gaussian functions and
optimized for relativistic Hamiltonians.</li>
<li><strong>Uncontracted Basis Sets</strong>: For very accurate
relativistic calculations, especially with DHF, uncontracted Gaussian
basis sets may be used.</li>
</ul>
<p>Computational relativistic chemistry is essential for understanding
and predicting the properties of heavy elements and their compounds.
Relativistic calculations are now routinely used in research areas such
as heavy element chemistry, catalysis, materials science, and nuclear
chemistry.</p>
<p>In summary, relativistic effects are not just minor corrections but
are crucial for understanding the chemistry and physics of heavy
elements. They are responsible for many unique and unexpected properties
of heavy elements, differentiating them significantly from their lighter
counterparts in the periodic table. Relativistic quantum chemistry
provides the theoretical and computational tools to accurately describe
these effects and explore the fascinating world of heavy element
chemistry.</p>

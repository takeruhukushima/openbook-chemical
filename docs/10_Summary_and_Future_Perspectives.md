# Summary and Future Perspectives

This textbook has provided a comprehensive journey through the essential concepts of relativistic chemistry and thermodynamics, with a focus on their applications in modern chemical science. We began by establishing the foundations of special relativity and quantum mechanics, then explored how these principles merge to form relativistic quantum chemistry.

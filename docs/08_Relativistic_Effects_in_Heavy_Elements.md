# Relativistic Effects in Heavy Elements

This chapter focuses specifically on the profound impact of relativistic effects on the properties of heavy elements. As we move down the periodic table, the inner core electrons in atoms of heavy elements approach speeds comparable to the speed of light. This necessitates the use of relativistic quantum mechanics to accurately describe their electronic structure and properties. We will explore how relativistic effects manifest in heavy elements, influencing their chemical behavior, physical properties, and spectroscopic characteristics.

## 8.1 Introduction to Heavy Elements

Heavy elements are generally considered to be those in the later periods and groups of the periodic table, typically starting from the 6th period (elements with atomic number Z > 54, Xenon). These elements are characterized by:

- **High Nuclear Charge**: Leading to strong electrostatic attraction between the nucleus and electrons.
- **Large Number of Electrons**: Resulting in complex electronic configurations and significant electron-electron interactions.
- **Inner Core Electrons at Relativistic Speeds**: Core electrons, especially s electrons, experience strong nuclear attraction and move at relativistic speeds.

Examples of heavy elements include gold (Au), mercury (Hg), lead (Pb), platinum (Pt), uranium (U), and transuranic elements.

## 8.2 Manifestations of Relativistic Effects in Heavy Elements

Relativistic effects in heavy elements lead to several significant consequences that deviate from non-relativistic predictions.

### 8.2.1 Relativistic Contraction and Stabilization of s Orbitals

- **Direct Relativistic Effect**: The most prominent relativistic effect is the contraction and stabilization of s orbitals. As discussed in earlier chapters, this is due to the increased velocity of s electrons near the nucleus, leading to relativistic mass increase and stronger binding.
- **Impact on Valence s Orbitals**: The contraction of core s orbitals propagates to valence s orbitals, making them more compact, lower in energy, and less available for bonding in some cases (inert pair effect).

### 8.2.2 Relativistic Expansion and Destabilization of p and d Orbitals

- **Indirect Relativistic Effect**: Due to the contraction of s orbitals, the shielding of the nuclear charge experienced by p, d, and f orbitals is enhanced. This leads to the expansion and destabilization of these orbitals.
- **Energy Level Splitting**: Relativistic effects, particularly spin-orbit coupling, cause splitting of p, d, and f orbitals into subshells with different energies.

### 8.2.3 Spin-Orbit Coupling in Heavy Elements

- **Significant Effect**: Spin-orbit coupling, the interaction between an electron's spin and its orbital angular momentum, becomes very strong in heavy elements due to the high nuclear charge and electron velocities.
- **j-j Coupling Scheme**: In heavy elements, the j-j coupling scheme, where individual electron spin and orbital angular momenta are coupled first ($j = l + s$), becomes more appropriate than the Russell-Saunders (L-S) coupling scheme, which is valid for lighter elements.
- **Splitting of Energy Levels**: Spin-orbit coupling splits atomic energy levels, leading to distinct spectroscopic and magnetic properties. For example, p orbitals split into $p_{1/2}$ and $p_{3/2}$ subshells, d orbitals into $d_{3/2}$ and $d_{5/2}$, etc.

## 8.3 Relativistic Effects on Chemical Properties

Relativistic effects dramatically alter the chemical properties of heavy elements, leading to unique behaviors that are not observed in lighter congeners.

### 8.3.1 Inert Pair Effect

- **Definition**: The inert pair effect is the tendency of heavier p-block elements (e.g., Tl, Pb, Bi) to be more stable in lower oxidation states than predicted by non-relativistic trends. For example, $Pb^{2+}$ is more stable than $Pb^{4+}$.
- **Relativistic Origin**: Relativistic contraction and stabilization of valence s orbitals ($ns$) make these orbitals less available for bonding, thus favoring lower oxidation states where the $ns^2$ electrons remain as a "lone pair."

### 8.3.2 Unique Properties of Gold

Gold (Au) exhibits several unusual properties due to relativistic effects:

- **Yellow Color**: The characteristic yellow color of gold is a relativistic effect. Relativistic calculations show that the $6s \rightarrow 5d$ electronic transition energy in gold is increased into the blue light region, causing absorption of blue light and reflection of yellow light. Non-relativistically, gold would be silvery.
- **Aurophilic Interactions**: Weak attractive interactions between closed-shell $Au(I)$ ions ($d^{10}-d^{10}$ interactions) are enhanced by relativistic effects, leading to unique supramolecular structures and materials.
- **High Electronegativity and Reactivity**: Relativistic effects increase the electronegativity of gold, making it more reactive than expected and enabling it to form compounds with higher oxidation states (e.g., $AuF_5$).

### 8.3.3 Liquidity of Mercury

Mercury (Hg) is liquid at room temperature, unlike other metals, due to relativistic effects:

- **Weak Hg-Hg Bonds**: Relativistic effects weaken the metallic bonding in mercury. The $6s$ orbital contraction reduces the overlap and interaction of valence electrons, lowering the cohesive energy and melting point of mercury.

### 8.3.4 Relativistic Effects in Superheavy Elements

Superheavy elements (SHEs, Z > 103) are predicted to have even more pronounced relativistic effects:

- **Orbital Energies and Ordering**: Relativistic effects can alter the ordering of electronic orbitals in SHEs, potentially leading to different valence electron configurations than predicted non-relativistically.
- **Stability of High Oxidation States**: Relativistic effects might stabilize unusually high oxidation states in some SHEs.
- **Chemical Properties**: Predictions of chemical properties of SHEs rely heavily on relativistic calculations, as experimental studies are extremely challenging due to their short half-lives and production difficulties.

## 8.4 Relativistic Effects on Physical Properties

Relativistic effects also influence the physical properties of heavy elements.

### 8.4.1 Melting and Boiling Points

- **Lower Melting Points**: For some heavy metals like mercury, relativistic effects lead to weaker metallic bonding and lower melting points.
- **Higher Boiling Points**: In some cases, relativistic effects can enhance interatomic interactions, potentially increasing boiling points, although this effect is less pronounced for melting points.

### 8.4.2 Density and Atomic Radii

- **Increased Density**: Relativistic contraction of orbitals leads to more compact atoms and increased density in heavy elements.
- **Reduced Atomic Radii**: Relativistic effects generally cause a decrease in atomic and ionic radii compared to non-relativistic predictions.

### 8.4.3 Ionization Potentials and Electron Affinities

- **Increased Ionization Potentials**: Relativistic stabilization of s orbitals increases the ionization potentials of heavy elements, making it more difficult to remove electrons.
- **Increased Electron Affinities**: Relativistic effects can also increase electron affinities in some heavy elements.

### 8.4.4 Spectroscopic Properties

- **Shifted Electronic Transitions**: Relativistic effects shift electronic transition energies, affecting UV-Vis spectra and colors of heavy element compounds (e.g., color of gold).
- **Spin-Orbit Splitting in Spectra**: Spin-orbit coupling leads to fine structure in atomic and molecular spectra of heavy elements.
- **Magnetic Properties**: Relativistic effects influence magnetic properties, such as magnetic susceptibility and NMR parameters, especially for paramagnetic heavy element compounds.

## 8.5 Computational Relativistic Chemistry

Accurate theoretical studies of heavy elements and their compounds require relativistic quantum chemical methods.

### 8.5.1 Relativistic Hamiltonians

- **Dirac Hamiltonian**: The Dirac Hamiltonian is the fully relativistic Hamiltonian for a single electron, incorporating special relativity.
- **Dirac-Coulomb Hamiltonian**: For many-electron systems, the Dirac-Coulomb Hamiltonian is often used, which includes the Dirac Hamiltonian for each electron and the Coulomb interaction between electrons.
- **Breit Interaction**: For higher accuracy, the Breit interaction can be added to account for relativistic corrections to electron-electron interactions.

### 8.5.2 Relativistic Quantum Chemical Methods

- **Dirac-Hartree-Fock (DHF)**: Relativistic extension of Hartree-Fock theory using the Dirac Hamiltonian.
- **Relativistic Density Functional Theory (RDFT)**: Relativistic versions of DFT, incorporating relativistic kinematics and spin-orbit coupling.
- **Relativistic Post-HF Methods**: Relativistic versions of post-Hartree-Fock methods like MPn, CI, and CC, such as relativistic coupled cluster (RCC) theory.
- **Douglas-Kroll-Hess (DKH) and Zeroth-Order Regular Approximation (ZORA)**: Approximations to the Dirac equation that simplify relativistic calculations while retaining most relativistic effects, often used in practical calculations.

### 8.5.3 Basis Sets for Relativistic Calculations

- **Relativistic Basis Sets**: Basis sets designed for relativistic calculations, often using contracted Gaussian functions and optimized for relativistic Hamiltonians.
- **Uncontracted Basis Sets**: For very accurate relativistic calculations, especially with DHF, uncontracted Gaussian basis sets may be used.

Computational relativistic chemistry is essential for understanding and predicting the properties of heavy elements and their compounds. Relativistic calculations are now routinely used in research areas such as heavy element chemistry, catalysis, materials science, and nuclear chemistry.

In summary, relativistic effects are not just minor corrections but are crucial for understanding the chemistry and physics of heavy elements. They are responsible for many unique and unexpected properties of heavy elements, differentiating them significantly from their lighter counterparts in the periodic table. Relativistic quantum chemistry provides the theoretical and computational tools to accurately describe these effects and explore the fascinating world of heavy element chemistry.

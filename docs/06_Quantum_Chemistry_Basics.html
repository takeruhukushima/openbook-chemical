<p>This chapter introduces the fundamental principles and methods of
quantum chemistry. Building upon the foundations of quantum mechanics,
atomic structure, and chemical bonding, we will explore how quantum
mechanics is applied to describe molecules and chemical reactions. This
chapter will cover essential approximations and computational techniques
used to solve the molecular Schrödinger equation, forming the basis for
understanding more advanced relativistic quantum chemistry methods
discussed in later chapters.</p>
<h2 id="introduction-to-quantum-chemistry">6.1 Introduction to Quantum
Chemistry</h2>
<p>Quantum chemistry is the branch of chemistry that applies quantum
mechanics to chemical systems. It aims to understand and predict
molecular properties, chemical reactions, and spectroscopic phenomena
from first principles, using the laws of quantum mechanics.</p>
<h3 id="the-molecular-schrödinger-equation">6.1.1 The Molecular
Schrödinger Equation</h3>
<p>The central equation in quantum chemistry is the molecular
Schrödinger equation, which describes the behavior of electrons and
nuclei in molecules:</p>
<p><span
class="math display"><em>Ĥ</em><em>Ψ</em>(<strong>r</strong>, <strong>R</strong>) = <em>E</em><em>Ψ</em>(<strong>r</strong>, <strong>R</strong>)</span></p>
<p>where: - <span class="math inline"><em>Ĥ</em></span> is the molecular
Hamiltonian operator. - <span
class="math inline"><em>Ψ</em>(<strong>r</strong>, <strong>R</strong>)</span>
is the molecular wavefunction, depending on electron coordinates <span
class="math inline"><strong>r</strong></span> and nuclear coordinates
<span class="math inline"><strong>R</strong></span>. - <span
class="math inline"><em>E</em></span> is the total energy of the
molecule.</p>
<p>The molecular Hamiltonian <span class="math inline"><em>Ĥ</em></span>
includes terms for: - Kinetic energy of electrons and nuclei. -
Potential energy of electron-nucleus attraction. - Potential energy of
electron-electron repulsion. - Potential energy of nucleus-nucleus
repulsion.</p>
<h3 id="born-oppenheimer-approximation">6.1.2 Born-Oppenheimer
Approximation</h3>
<p>Solving the molecular Schrödinger equation exactly is extremely
challenging for polyatomic molecules. The Born-Oppenheimer approximation
simplifies the problem by separating nuclear and electronic motion. Due
to the large mass difference between nuclei and electrons, we assume
that nuclei are stationary relative to the much faster-moving
electrons.</p>
<p>Under the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, the molecular wavefunction
is separated into electronic and nuclear wavefunctions:</p>
<p><span
class="math display"><em>Ψ</em>(<strong>r</strong>, <strong>R</strong>) ≈ <em>ψ</em><sub><em>e</em><em>l</em><em>e</em><em>c</em></sub>(<strong>r</strong>; <strong>R</strong>) × <em>χ</em><sub><em>n</em><em>u</em><em>c</em></sub>(<strong>R</strong>)</span></p>
<p>The electronic Schrödinger equation is solved for fixed nuclear
positions <span class="math inline"><strong>R</strong></span>:</p>
<p><span
class="math display"><em>Ĥ</em><sub><em>e</em><em>l</em><em>e</em><em>c</em></sub><em>ψ</em><sub><em>e</em><em>l</em><em>e</em><em>c</em></sub>(<strong>r</strong>; <strong>R</strong>) = <em>E</em><sub><em>e</em><em>l</em><em>e</em><em>c</em></sub>(<strong>R</strong>)<em>ψ</em><sub><em>e</em><em>l</em><em>e</em><em>c</em></sub>(<strong>r</strong>; <strong>R</strong>)</span></p>
<p>The electronic Hamiltonian <span
class="math inline"><em>Ĥ</em><sub><em>e</em><em>l</em><em>e</em><em>c</em></sub></span>
includes kinetic energy of electrons and all potential energy terms,
while treating nuclear positions as parameters. The eigenvalue <span
class="math inline"><em>E</em><sub><em>e</em><em>l</em><em>e</em><em>c</em></sub>(<strong>R</strong>)</span>
is the electronic energy, which depends on nuclear positions and serves
as the potential energy for nuclear motion.</p>
<h2 id="electronic-structure-methods">6.2 Electronic Structure
Methods</h2>
<p>Solving the electronic Schrödinger equation is still complex and
requires further approximations. Various electronic structure methods
have been developed, broadly categorized into:</p>
<h3 id="hartree-fock-hf-theory">6.2.1 Hartree-Fock (HF) Theory</h3>
<p>Hartree-Fock (HF) theory is a foundational method in quantum
chemistry that approximates the many-electron wavefunction by a single
Slater determinant of spin-orbitals. It treats electron-electron
interactions in an average way, neglecting instantaneous electron
correlation.</p>
<h4 id="key-approximations-in-hf-theory">Key Approximations in HF
Theory:</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Independent Electron Approximation</strong>: Each electron
moves in an effective potential created by the average field of all
other electrons and nuclei.</li>
<li><strong>Variational Principle</strong>: The HF energy is an upper
bound to the exact ground state energy.</li>
<li><strong>Self-Consistent Field (SCF) Procedure</strong>: The HF
equations are solved iteratively until the electron density and energy
converge.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="limitations-of-hf-theory">Limitations of HF Theory:</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Neglect of Electron Correlation</strong>: HF theory does not
account for the instantaneous correlation between electron motions,
leading to overestimation of energies and inaccurate descriptions of
certain molecular properties.</li>
<li><strong>Basis Set Dependence</strong>: Accuracy depends on the
choice of atomic basis sets used to represent molecular orbitals.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="post-hartree-fock-methods">6.2.2 Post-Hartree-Fock Methods</h3>
<p>Post-Hartree-Fock methods aim to improve upon HF theory by including
electron correlation effects. These methods are generally more
computationally demanding than HF.</p>
<h4 id="examples-of-post-hf-methods">Examples of Post-HF Methods:</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Møller-Plesset Perturbation Theory (MPn)</strong>: Treats
electron correlation as a perturbation to the HF wavefunction. MP2
(second-order MP theory) is a common and relatively cost-effective
method.</li>
<li><strong>Configuration Interaction (CI)</strong>: Expands the
wavefunction as a linear combination of Slater determinants representing
different electronic configurations. Full CI is exact within a given
basis set but computationally very expensive. Truncated CI methods like
CISD (CI with singles and doubles) are more practical.</li>
<li><strong>Coupled Cluster (CC) Theory</strong>: Provides a highly
accurate description of electron correlation by exponentiating cluster
operators. CCSD (CC with singles and doubles) and CCSD(T) (CCSD with
perturbative triples) are widely used high-accuracy methods.</li>
<li><strong>Multi-Configurational Self-Consistent Field
(MCSCF)</strong>: Optimizes both molecular orbitals and configuration
coefficients simultaneously, important for describing molecules with
multireference character (e.g., bond breaking, excited states).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="density-functional-theory-dft">6.2.3 Density Functional Theory
(DFT)</h3>
<p>Density Functional Theory (DFT) is a widely used electronic structure
method that, in principle, exactly accounts for electron correlation at
a lower computational cost than many post-HF methods. DFT is based on
the Hohenberg-Kohn theorems, which state that the ground state
electronic energy and all other ground state properties are uniquely
determined by the electron density <span
class="math inline"><em>ρ</em>(<strong>r</strong>)</span>.</p>
<h4 id="key-concepts-in-dft">Key Concepts in DFT:</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Electron Density as Basic Variable</strong>: DFT focuses on
the electron density <span
class="math inline"><em>ρ</em>(<strong>r</strong>)</span> instead of the
many-electron wavefunction.</li>
<li><strong>Kohn-Sham Equations</strong>: A set of effective
single-particle equations that yield the exact electron density of the
interacting system.</li>
<li><strong>Exchange-Correlation Functional</strong>: The central
unknown in DFT is the exchange-correlation functional <span
class="math inline"><em>E</em><sub><em>x</em><em>c</em></sub>[<em>ρ</em>]</span>,
which accounts for exchange and correlation effects. Approximations to
<span
class="math inline"><em>E</em><sub><em>x</em><em>c</em></sub>[<em>ρ</em>]</span>
are crucial for the accuracy of DFT calculations.</li>
</ul>
<h4
id="common-approximations-for-exchange-correlation-functionals">Common
Approximations for Exchange-Correlation Functionals:</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Local Density Approximation (LDA)</strong>: Approximates
<span
class="math inline"><em>E</em><sub><em>x</em><em>c</em></sub>[<em>ρ</em>]</span>
locally based on the uniform electron gas.</li>
<li><strong>Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA)</strong>: Includes
gradients of the density in <span
class="math inline"><em>E</em><sub><em>x</em><em>c</em></sub>[<em>ρ</em>]</span>,
improving upon LDA. Common GGAs include BLYP and PBE.</li>
<li><strong>Hybrid Functionals</strong>: Mixes HF exchange with DFT
exchange and correlation, such as B3LYP and PBE0, often providing better
accuracy for thermochemistry and kinetics.</li>
<li><strong>Meta-GGA Functionals</strong>: Include second derivatives of
the density or kinetic energy density, further improving accuracy.</li>
<li><strong>Range-Separated Functionals</strong>: Separates exchange
interaction into short-range and long-range parts, useful for systems
with charge-transfer or long-range interactions.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="advantages-of-dft">Advantages of DFT:</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Computational Efficiency</strong>: DFT is generally less
computationally demanding than post-HF methods, allowing for
calculations on larger molecules.</li>
<li><strong>Inclusion of Electron Correlation</strong>: DFT, in
principle, includes electron correlation, often providing better
accuracy than HF theory.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="limitations-of-dft">Limitations of DFT:</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Approximation of Exchange-Correlation Functional</strong>:
The exact form of <span
class="math inline"><em>E</em><sub><em>x</em><em>c</em></sub>[<em>ρ</em>]</span>
is unknown, and the accuracy of DFT calculations depends on the quality
of the approximate functional used.</li>
<li><strong>Challenges with Dispersion Interactions and Strong
Correlation</strong>: Standard DFT functionals may struggle with van der
Waals dispersion interactions and strongly correlated systems.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="basis-sets">6.3 Basis Sets</h2>
<p>In quantum chemical calculations, molecular orbitals are typically
expanded as linear combinations of atomic basis functions. The choice of
basis set affects the accuracy and computational cost of
calculations.</p>
<h3 id="types-of-basis-sets">6.3.1 Types of Basis Sets</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Slater-Type Orbitals (STOs)</strong>: Functions that
resemble atomic orbitals and have the correct exponential decay. STO-3G
is a minimal basis set using Gaussian approximations to STOs.</li>
<li><strong>Gaussian-Type Orbitals (GTOs)</strong>: Gaussian functions
are computationally more efficient than STOs for evaluating integrals.
Basis sets are typically constructed from contracted Gaussian functions
(CGFs), which are linear combinations of primitive Gaussians.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="common-basis-set-families">6.3.2 Common Basis Set Families</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pople-style basis sets</strong>: e.g., 6-31G, 6-31G(d),
6-31+G(d,p). Split-valence basis sets (e.g., 6-31G) describe core and
valence electrons with different numbers of basis functions.
Polarization functions (e.g., (d), (d,p)) add functions with higher
angular momentum to allow for better description of molecular bonding.
Diffuse functions (e.g., +) are important for anions and Rydberg
states.</li>
<li><strong>Correlation-Consistent basis sets (cc-pVnZ)</strong>:
Designed for correlation calculations and systematically converge to the
complete basis set limit as n increases (cc-pVDZ, cc-pVTZ, cc-pVQZ,
etc.). Augmented versions (aug-cc-pVnZ) include diffuse functions.</li>
<li><strong>Polarization-Consistent basis sets (pc-n)</strong>:
Optimized for DFT calculations and provide systematic convergence for
DFT energies and properties.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="basis-set-superposition-error-bsse">6.3.3 Basis Set
Superposition Error (BSSE)</h3>
<p>When using finite basis sets, especially for intermolecular
interactions, Basis Set Superposition Error (BSSE) can arise. BSSE is an
artifact that artificially lowers the energy of interacting systems due
to basis functions from one molecule “borrowing” basis functions from
another molecule to improve its description. BSSE can be corrected using
methods like the Counterpoise Correction.</p>
<h2 id="molecular-properties">6.4 Molecular Properties</h2>
<p>Quantum chemistry methods can be used to calculate a wide range of
molecular properties beyond energies and structures:</p>
<h3 id="electronic-properties">6.4.1 Electronic Properties</h3>

charge distribution in a molecule.</li>
<li><strong>Polarizability</strong>: Measures the response of a molecule
to an electric field.</li>

(MEP)</strong>: Visualize charge distribution and reactive sites in

<h1 id="thermodynamics-foundations">Thermodynamics Foundations</h1>
<p>This chapter introduces the foundational principles of
thermodynamics, which are essential for understanding chemical
reactions, phase transitions, and the behavior of matter at the
macroscopic level. While thermodynamics is a classical theory, its
principles are indispensable in chemistry and provide the framework for
understanding energy, entropy, and equilibrium. These concepts will be
crucial when we later discuss advanced thermodynamics and statistical
mechanics in relativistic contexts.</p>
<h2 id="basic-concepts-and-definitions">4.1 Basic Concepts and
Definitions</h2>
<p>Thermodynamics is concerned with energy and its transformations. It
deals with macroscopic systems and their properties, such as
temperature, pressure, volume, and chemical potential.</p>
<h3 id="system-and-surroundings">4.1.1 System and Surroundings</h3>
<p>In thermodynamics, a system is the part of the universe that is under
study, while the surroundings are everything outside the system. Systems
can be classified as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Isolated system</strong>: No exchange of matter or energy
with the surroundings.</li>
<li><strong>Closed system</strong>: Exchange of energy but not matter
with the surroundings.</li>
<li><strong>Open system</strong>: Exchange of both energy and matter
with the surroundings.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="thermodynamic-properties">4.1.2 Thermodynamic Properties</h3>
<p>Thermodynamic properties are macroscopic characteristics of a system.
They can be classified as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intensive properties</strong>: Independent of the amount of
substance in the system (e.g., temperature, pressure, density).</li>
<li><strong>Extensive properties</strong>: Dependent on the amount of
substance in the system (e.g., volume, mass, energy).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="state-functions-and-path-functions">4.1.3 State Functions and
Path Functions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>State functions</strong>: Properties that depend only on the
current state of the system, not on the path taken to reach that state
(e.g., internal energy, enthalpy, entropy, Gibbs free energy).</li>
<li><strong>Path functions</strong>: Properties that depend on the path
taken between two states (e.g., heat, work).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="equilibrium-and-processes">4.1.4 Equilibrium and Processes</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Thermodynamic equilibrium</strong>: A state where the
system’s properties are not changing with time, and there are no net
flows of energy or matter within the system or between the system and
surroundings.</li>
<li><strong>Thermodynamic process</strong>: A change in the state of a
system. Processes can be:
<ul>
<li><strong>Isothermal</strong>: Constant temperature.</li>
<li><strong>Isobaric</strong>: Constant pressure.</li>
<li><strong>Isochoric</strong>: Constant volume.</li>
<li><strong>Adiabatic</strong>: No heat exchange with the
surroundings.</li>
<li><strong>Reversible</strong>: A process that can be reversed by an
infinitesimal change in conditions, and the system is always in
equilibrium.</li>
<li><strong>Irreversible</strong>: A process that cannot be reversed,
and the system is not in equilibrium during the process.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-first-law-of-thermodynamics">4.2 The First Law of
Thermodynamics</h2>
<p>The first law of thermodynamics is the principle of energy
conservation. It states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only
converted from one form to another.</p>
<h3 id="internal-energy-u">4.2.1 Internal Energy (U)</h3>
<p>Internal energy (U) is the total energy stored within a system,
including kinetic and potential energies of molecules. It is a state
function.</p>
<h3 id="heat-q-and-work-w">4.2.2 Heat (q) and Work (w)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Heat (q)</strong>: Energy transferred between the system and
surroundings due to a temperature difference. Positive q means heat is
absorbed by the system (endothermic), negative q means heat is released
by the system (exothermic).</li>
<li><strong>Work (w)</strong>: Energy transferred between the system and
surroundings due to a force acting through a distance, other than
temperature difference. In chemistry, common work is pressure-volume
work (expansion or compression). Positive w means work is done on the
system, negative w means work is done by the system.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="mathematical-statement-of-the-first-law">4.2.3 Mathematical
Statement of the First Law</h3>
<p>The change in internal energy (<span
class="math inline"><em>Δ</em><em>U</em></span>) of a closed system is
given by:</p>
<p><span
class="math display"><em>Δ</em><em>U</em> = <em>q</em> + <em>w</em></span></p>
<p>For infinitesimal changes, it is written as:</p>
<p><span
class="math display"><em>d</em><em>U</em> = <em>d</em><em>q</em> + <em>d</em><em>w</em></span></p>
<h3 id="enthalpy-h">4.2.4 Enthalpy (H)</h3>
<p>Enthalpy (H) is a state function defined as:</p>
<p><span
class="math display"><em>H</em> = <em>U</em> + <em>P</em><em>V</em></span></p>
<p>where P is pressure and V is volume. The change in enthalpy (<span
class="math inline"><em>Δ</em><em>H</em></span>) at constant pressure is
equal to the heat exchanged with the surroundings:</p>
<p><span
class="math display"><em>Δ</em><em>H</em> = <em>Δ</em><em>U</em> + <em>P</em><em>Δ</em><em>V</em> = <em>q</em><sub><em>p</em></sub></span></p>
<p>Enthalpy is particularly useful for studying reactions at constant
pressure (common in chemistry).</p>
<h2 id="the-second-law-of-thermodynamics">4.3 The Second Law of
Thermodynamics</h2>
<p>The second law of thermodynamics introduces the concept of entropy
and the direction of spontaneous processes. It states that the total
entropy of an isolated system always increases or remains constant in a
reversible process.</p>
<h3 id="entropy-s">4.3.1 Entropy (S)</h3>
<p>Entropy (S) is a state function that measures the degree of disorder
or randomness in a system. It is related to the number of microstates
(<span class="math inline"><em>Ω</em></span>) accessible to the
system:</p>
<p><span
class="math display"><em>S</em> = <em>k</em><sub><em>B</em></sub>ln <em>Ω</em></span></p>
<p>where <span
class="math inline"><em>k</em><sub><em>B</em></sub></span> is the
Boltzmann constant.</p>
<h3 id="change-in-entropy-delta-s">4.3.2 Change in Entropy (<span
class="math inline"><em>Δ</em><em>S</em></span>)</h3>
<p>The change in entropy (<span
class="math inline"><em>Δ</em><em>S</em></span>) for a reversible
process at temperature T is given by:</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$
\Delta S = \frac{q_{rev}}{T}
$$</span></p>
<p>For irreversible processes, <span class="math inline">$\Delta S &gt;
\frac{q}{T}$</span>.</p>
<h3 id="second-law-statement">4.3.3 Second Law Statement</h3>
<p>The second law of thermodynamics can be stated in several ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>For any spontaneous process in an isolated system, the entropy
increases (<span
class="math inline"><em>Δ</em><em>S</em><sub><em>t</em><em>o</em><em>t</em><em>a</em><em>l</em></sub> &gt; 0</span>).</li>
<li>The entropy of the universe tends to increase.</li>
<li>Heat cannot spontaneously flow from a colder body to a hotter
body.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="statistical-interpretation-of-entropy">4.3.4 Statistical
Interpretation of Entropy</h3>
<p>Entropy is related to the probability of a state. Systems tend to
evolve towards states of higher probability and greater disorder.</p>
<h2 id="the-third-law-of-thermodynamics">4.4 The Third Law of
Thermodynamics</h2>
<p>The third law of thermodynamics defines the absolute zero of entropy.
It states that the entropy of a perfect crystal at absolute zero (0 K)
is zero.</p>
<h3 id="statement-of-the-third-law">4.4.1 Statement of the Third
Law</h3>
<p>The entropy of a perfect crystalline substance at absolute zero
temperature is zero:</p>
<p><span class="math display"><em>S</em>(<em>T</em> = 0
K) = 0</span></p>
<h3 id="implications-of-the-third-law">4.4.2 Implications of the Third
Law</h3>
<ul>
<li>It provides a reference point for entropy calculations.</li>
<li>It implies that absolute zero is unattainable in a finite number of
steps.</li>
<li>It allows for the calculation of absolute entropies at different
temperatures using heat capacity data.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="gibbs-free-energy-g">4.5 Gibbs Free Energy (G)</h2>
<p>Gibbs free energy (G) is a thermodynamic potential that combines
enthalpy and entropy to determine the spontaneity of a process at
constant temperature and pressure.</p>
<h3 id="definition-of-gibbs-free-energy">4.5.1 Definition of Gibbs Free
Energy</h3>
<p>Gibbs free energy (G) is defined as:</p>
<p><span
class="math display"><em>G</em> = <em>H</em> − <em>T</em><em>S</em></span></p>
<p>where H is enthalpy, T is temperature, and S is entropy. Gibbs free
energy is a state function.</p>
<h3 id="change-in-gibbs-free-energy-delta-g">4.5.2 Change in Gibbs Free
Energy (<span class="math inline"><em>Δ</em><em>G</em></span>)</h3>

<h3 id="spontaneity-and-equilibrium">4.5.3 Spontaneity and
Equilibrium</h3>
<p>Gibbs free energy is a criterion for spontaneity at constant
temperature and pressure:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline"><em>Δ</em><em>G</em> &lt; 0</span>:
Process is spontaneous ( Gibbs free energy decreases).</li>
<li><span class="math inline"><em>Δ</em><em>G</em> &gt; 0</span>:
Process is non-spontaneous ( Gibbs free energy increases, reverse
process is spontaneous).</li>
<li><span class="math inline"><em>Δ</em><em>G</em> = 0</span>: Process
is at equilibrium (no net change).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="standard-gibbs-free-energy-of-formation-delta-g_fcirc">4.5.4
Standard Gibbs Free Energy of Formation (<span
class="math inline"><em>Δ</em><em>G</em><sub><em>f</em></sub><sup>∘</sup></span>)</h3>
<p>The standard Gibbs free energy of formation (<span
class="math inline"><em>Δ</em><em>G</em><sub><em>f</em></sub><sup>∘</sup></span>)
is the change in Gibbs free energy when one mole of a compound is formed
from its elements in their standard states. It is used to calculate the
standard Gibbs free energy change for reactions:</p>
<p><span
class="math display"><em>Δ</em><em>G</em><sub><em>r</em><em>x</em><em>n</em></sub><sup>∘</sup> = ∑<em>ν</em><sub><em>i</em></sub><em>Δ</em><em>G</em><sub><em>f</em></sub><sup>∘</sup>(products) − ∑<em>ν</em><sub><em>i</em></sub><em>Δ</em><em>G</em><sub><em>f</em></sub><sup>∘</sup>(reactants)</span></p>
<p>where <span
class="math inline"><em>ν</em><sub><em>i</em></sub></span> are the
stoichiometric coefficients.</p>
<h2 id="chemical-potential-mu">4.6 Chemical Potential (<span
class="math inline"><em>μ</em></span>)</h2>
<p>Chemical potential (<span class="math inline"><em>μ</em></span>) is
the change in Gibbs free energy with respect to the change in the amount
of a component, at constant temperature, pressure, and amounts of other
components.</p>
<h3 id="definition-of-chemical-potential">4.6.1 Definition of Chemical
Potential</h3>
<p>For a component <span class="math inline"><em>i</em></span> in a
mixture, the chemical potential <span
class="math inline"><em>μ</em><sub><em>i</em></sub></span> is defined
as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$
\mu_i = \left(\frac{\partial G}{\partial n_i}\right)_{T, P, n_{j\neq i}}
$$</span></p>
<p>where <span
class="math inline"><em>n</em><sub><em>i</em></sub></span> is the amount
of component <span class="math inline"><em>i</em></span>, and <span
class="math inline"><em>n</em><sub><em>j</em> ≠ <em>i</em></sub></span>
represents the amounts of all other components.</p>
<h3 id="significance-of-chemical-potential">4.6.2 Significance of
Chemical Potential</h3>
<ul>
<li>Chemical potential is the driving force for chemical reactions and
phase transitions.</li>
<li>Systems tend to move towards states of lower chemical
potential.</li>
<li>At equilibrium, the chemical potential of each component is the same
in all phases or regions of the system.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="chemical-potential-and-phase-equilibrium">4.6.3 Chemical
Potential and Phase Equilibrium</h3>
<p>For a substance distributed between two phases (<span
class="math inline"><em>α</em></span> and <span

<p><span
class="math display"><em>μ</em><sub><em>i</em></sub><sup><em>α</em></sup> = <em>μ</em><sub><em>i</em></sub><sup><em>β</em></sup></span></p>
<p>This condition is fundamental for understanding phase transitions and
phase diagrams.</p>
<h2 id="applications-of-thermodynamics">4.7 Applications of
